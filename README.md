About ERP_MSCC Toolbox

This toolbox provides an opportunity to process spatio-temporal ERP data using cluster analysis methodology.
 
A consensus clustering and new time-window determination mechanisms have been developed for measuring best suitable time-window for measuring ERPs of interest.
 
Additionally, a repeated ANOVA measurement has been designed for fast statistical analysis from measured mean latency amplitude of detected ERPs of interest.
